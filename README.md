# Landmark Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a landmark classification system using **Transfer Learning** with **VGG19**.  
Given an image, the model predicts the landmark category it belongs to.

The code is designed for small-scale experiments and learning purposes, with a clean training and evaluation loop.
